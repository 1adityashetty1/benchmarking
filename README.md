Introduction
-------------------------

lzbench is an in-memory benchmark of the fastest open-source LZ77/LZSS compressors. It joins all compressors into a single exe. 
At the beginning an input file is read to memory. 
Then all compressors are used to compress and decompress the file and decompressed file is verified. 
This approach has a big advantage of using the same compiler with the same optimizations for all compressors. 
The disadvantage is that it requires source code of each compressor (therefore Slug or lzturbo are not included).


Options
-------------------------

- The "-iX" option selects number of iterations (default 1) and displays best time of X iterations.
- The "-bX" option divides input data in blocks/chunks of size X KB (default = 2097152 KB)
- The "-sX" selects only compressors with compression speed over X MB (default = 100 MB) - so far it's only approximation


Compilation
-------------------------
For Linux/Unix:
```
make BUILD_SYSTEM=linux
```

For Windows (MinGW)
```
make
```

To remove one of compressors you can add -DBENCH_REMOVE_XXX to $DEFINES in Makefile (e.g. DEFINES += -DBENCH_REMOVE_LZ5 to remove LZ5).
